Hello! I'm Christian a Software Engineer with aa career path focused on
- Software Development
- Distribuited Systems
- Big Data Management

I'm currently involved in software development in PagoPA S.p.A. for the SEND platform.
I mainly write Java code with Spring, but I also use Python and Typescript when needed.
Lately I've been studying Go Language to approach cloud native development.

Moreover, I've been working for a long time with the AWS cloud, especially with the serverless services.

In my spare time I love to follow updates in astronomy, read manga and play soccer with my friends.
